<p>Nothing super interesting to report. I went in to the office 4 days this week, a rarity since the pandemic. It felt pretty tiring by the end, but I was reminded that I used to go in 5 days a week <em>every week</em>, so I think I&rsquo;ll readjust pretty quickly. I continue to enjoy going into the office to have some separation between work and home, and it&rsquo;s been really nice to see my coworkers that come into the office as well. I love a routine, and there&rsquo;s been a lot of changes to my work environment recently so it&rsquo;s been fun establishing new ones.</p>
<p>The California Poppies are in full bloom all over Twin Peaks, so I went up with a coffee on Saturday morning to enjoy the spring energy and clear weather while it still lasts. This morning I awoke to rain, and rushed out to meet it head on with a much chillier and wetter walk to twin peaks. Just as invigorating though! It&rsquo;s nice to see the chronicle is on board with my assertion last week that the only cure for this weather is <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/nativeson/article/cabin-fever-virus-no-vaccination-fight-17844628.php#photo-23584218" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a nice little walk</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KRAZAM" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Krazam</a> videos. I think their most recent, presented live on stage at a tech conference, is their most ambitious one yet, and their most successful. In an industry with possibly the worst collective sense of humor imaginable, we are blessed with a Krazam that we do not deserve.

<p>My alma mater Purdue University entered the NCAA tournament this weekend as the number 1 seed in their bracket. This was preceded by <a href="https://theathletic.com/4298487/2023/03/11/purdue-zach-edey-big-ten-tournament/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >many</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/17/sports/ncaabasketball/zach-edey-purdue.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >breathless</a> articles about the uniqueness of their situation, having built their entire team around a 7-foot-4 305 pound center whose singular weakness, as far as I can tell, is that he simply is not good at basketball. Purdue has never failed to disappoint me over the years, so I was delighted to watch the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/17/sports/ncaabasketball/fairleigh-dickinson-purdue-upset.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >team absolutely crumble</a> in the very first game, becoming only the second #1 seed ever to lose to a #16 seed in the first round. Yesterday I got a little more of my schadenfreude fix with this <a href="https://theathletic.com/4323873/2023/03/18/fairleigh-dickinson-purdue-cbs-ncaa-tournament/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >detailed writeup</a> of what it was like to work the broadcast for such a historic game.

<p>I saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOj0lRfKiVE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >trailer for the Blackberry movie</a> and refuse to believe that that&rsquo;s the actual tone of the movie. With that cast and that premise, it <em>has</em> to be a parody. But we do live in an era of Ben Affleck <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOhhGFCsGrY" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >directing a film</a> about the white guys at Nike who dared to ask Michael Jordan to wear their shoe, so I don&rsquo;t know what to think anymore. Instead of embedding either of those videos, please enjoy this incredible old sketch from the writer, director, and one of the stars of the Blackberry movie.

I don&rsquo;t use it for much, but the built-in Zoom functionality means that Zoom links open directly in Zoom instead of littering my browser with useless zoom tabs that I need to clean up. There&rsquo;s also a great option to strip tracking parameters out of links, but I have that disabled for web development reasons.

<p><a href="https://one-sec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >One Sec App</a>. I recently tried out One Sec for about a week, it&rsquo;s sort of a souped up version of iOS&rsquo;s existing Screen Time functionality. It&rsquo;s got some great ideas, for example I really like the choices of different animations when you need to take a break before using an application. Taking a single slow deep breath is always helpful and restorative, yet I almost never think to do it. Ultimately I stopped using the app because the implementation method was sort of flakey and a pain to set up (everything is done using iOS shortcuts, which you must painfully set up manually for each app you want to limit your time on). This is Apple&rsquo;s fault for limitations around its APIs, not the creators of One Sec. Personally I&rsquo;m hoping that Apple Sherlocks them and builds most of this functionality directly into Screen Time itself.</p>

<p>The weather in the Bay Area has been rough for the past few weeks, so I haven&rsquo;t been out too much. Part of the joy of living in California is that you kind of give up on fighting the weather. If the weather sucks, just stay inside until it changes, it usually won&rsquo;t be long. This is the maybe worst non-fire-related block of weather I&rsquo;ve experienced since I&rsquo;ve lived in San Francisco, and I finally hit my breaking point this weekend on the &ldquo;wait it out&rdquo; strategy. I got out the limited rain appropriate gear I have, and went for some hikes in the pouring rain. It was glorious, and I now know that I can walk to a peak of Twin Peaks in about 20 minutes from the apartment I recently moved to. I feel invigorated and refreshed, and no longer down in the dumps about the weather. I mean, it&rsquo;s just wet, it&rsquo;s not cold! Today I tried to time my walk with maximum rain, and although I didn&rsquo;t time it perfectly it felt freeing to aim for it. Watching a rainstorm come in from the top of a hill is right up there with watching a brilliant sunset imo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also really going through a ramen phase, getting <a href="https://www.marufukuramen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Marufuku Ramen</a> every time the dreary weather gets to me. Marufuku delivers everything in separate containers, so it delivers very well and reheats wonderfully. I&rsquo;ve started ordering two every time I order so I can have another one the next day.</p>

This video is a real nostalgic slice of suburban Americana. I didn&rsquo;t play &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; roofball growing up, but &ldquo;throw a ball on the roof and then try to catch it when it comes back down&rdquo; is definitely something I spent hours doing with friends. Loved the deadpan commentary, the of-the-era &ldquo;iPood&rdquo; parody T-shirt, and the live &ldquo;shame cam&rdquo; in the house for your walk of shame when you throw the ball over the roof.

<li>Knock at the Cabin</li>
<li>The Menu</li>
<li>Magic Mike XXL (a rewatch. It&rsquo;s tons better than the new one, and the gas station sequence is one of the greatest things I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a theater. If you haven&rsquo;t seen the scene, the only context you need is that Joe Manganiello has lost his mojo and has decided he needs to make this cashier smile or he&rsquo;ll stop dancing forever. Also, they&rsquo;re all on molly.)

Major &ldquo;that&rsquo;s fine for Merlin&rdquo; energy on this one, I don&rsquo;t think these arguments apply for most folks trying to make software for people to use (he makes this explicit in the post).

<li>I&rsquo;ve really been enjoying playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294420/Rollerdrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Rollerdrome</a> on my Steam Deck. It&rsquo;s sort of a Tony Hawk Pro Skater shooter, with bullet time and a really cool art style. A great single player game! I&rsquo;ve 100%-ed the main game, and am now working through the post game higher difficulty modes.

<li>John Gruber&rsquo;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/03/11/ep-370" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >The Talk Show podcast episode</a> with Jason Kottke on the 25th anniversary of Kottke.org. I&rsquo;m no longer a regular reader or listener of Gruber or Kottke, but this nostalgia trip through the history of blogging and the rise of paywalls/death of APIs was a fun listen in the current collapse of Twitter climate. I&rsquo;m not a 2Xer generally but this bad boy is over 3 hours and &hellip; works very well at 2X speed.</li>
<li>I wrote most of this post listening to the new-ish albums from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0HiZ8fNXwJOQcrf5iflrdz?si=JymDWp-yQHSgrPBB7EFrXA" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Miley Cyrus</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3l2Gi0hMjZV2uvKoWlFkoQ?si=_x4wyn4BShG44WRt7WjZSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Carly Rae Jepsen</a>. They&rsquo;re great.</li>

<p><a href="https://arc.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Arc Browser</a>. I&rsquo;m very hesitant to switch browsers, but last year I tried out Vivaldi after reading <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/vivaldi-4-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >an article in Wired</a> (use <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fvivaldi-4-2021%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >12ft.io</a> to sidestep the paywall). I didn&rsquo;t end up sticking with Vivaldi, but I did like the idea of vertical tabs. Anyway, I finally gave Arc Browser a try and have really been enjoying it. There&rsquo;s a lot of features I don&rsquo;t currently have any interest in, but the command palette, vertical tabs, and the shockingly game changing <a href="https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/arc-browsers-peek-simplified-way-of-interacting-with-tabs-6d1a17d4dab1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&ldquo;Peek&rdquo; feature</a> have caused me to stick with it for the last couple weeks. I still do development in Chrome, and I intellectually miss the incredible performance and battery life wins of Safari, but I&rsquo;ve got a fast computer that&rsquo;s always plugged in so I&rsquo;m fine taking the hit right now.</p>

<p><a href="https://ia.net/presenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >iA Presenter</a>. I recently used iA Presenter, currently in beta, to make a presentation for work and I found it equal parts pleasant and maddening. I&rsquo;ve loved and used their excellent <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >iA Writer</a> for years now, but I don&rsquo;t think this new tool is going to be a good fit for my needs. In the invite email, they explicitly say &ldquo;You probably won’t enjoy iA Presenter that much if you are looking for a Markdown PowerPoint-clone&rdquo;, which turns out is exactly what I want. This tool seems great for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t work in a corporate job that demands slides with bullets of text on them. I understand the designer community disdain for the &ldquo;slide full of bullets&rdquo;, but in my corporate job most people don&rsquo;t come to the presentation and just wanna skim through the slides later anyway. Anyway, if you want a way to easily make aesthetically pleasing slides while mostly working in text, and you don&rsquo;t need the ability to make pixel perfect layout decisions, maybe this is a good tool for you. Just be aware that if people would like a copy of the slides, your only export options are markdown, the ugliest PDF you&rsquo;ve ever seen*, or a 10 megabyte folder containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>Update: there&rsquo;s several options to make PDF export better, I like the &ldquo;1 Slide, Borderless&rdquo; option personally. Thanks for <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@FIGBERT/110014371528338371" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the tip</a> @FIGBERT!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://feedbin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >FeedBin</a>. I&rsquo;ve finally switched to FeedBin in advance of the death of my long used and beloved <a href="https://feedwrangler.net/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Feed Wrangler</a>. I stuck with Feed Wrangler for a long time mostly because I built my own web app to use as an RSS reader and it was built specifically to Feed Wrangler&rsquo;s API. Now that I&rsquo;ve been forced to switch, I updated my web app to support FeedBin and it&rsquo;s been smooth sailing ever since. I really love FeedBin&rsquo;s newsletter and twitter support. You can give a newsletter a custom feedbin email address and have all of your newsletters in the RSS reader interface, and you can also follow twitter accounts and have those piped in, which is great because twitter hasn&rsquo;t had RSS support for years. I fully expect the twitter integration to break in the next few months because of twitter&rsquo;s current situation, but for now it&rsquo;s been nice.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@fediversereport/109813142639096272" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >StreetPass</a>, a browser extension that will collect mastodon profiles for web sites you visit throughout the day, and let you choose to follow them. What I love about this is that it&rsquo;s powered by the links that <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Mastodon checks to verify bio links</a>, so people don&rsquo;t have to be aware of this browser extension to support it. Long live the Open Web and meta tags, baby!</p>

<p><a href="https://social.coop/@graue/109719222045865339" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BikeHopper</a>, an open source directions app for transit and bikes. Google Maps bike directions are pretty ok in San Francisco, but there&rsquo;s definitely room for improvement. I usually start with Google Maps directions and then end up following cyclists on my route who look like they know what they&rsquo;re doing. I frequently end up on a safer and smoother route than the initial one Google recommends. Hopefully this tool helps as well!</p>

<p>The great Darius Kazemi&rsquo;s <a href="https://tinysubversions.com/twitter-archive/make-your-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >got a tool</a> for taking your exported twitter archive and making it accessible and searchable. I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of Darius ever since his incredible deadpan XOXO talk skewering lucky successful tech people who like to advise others on how to mirror their success, as if it&rsquo;s a repeatable process.
