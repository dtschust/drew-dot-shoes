I love a routine, and there’s been a lot of changes to my work environment recently so it’s been fun establishing new ones.\nThe California Poppies are in full bloom all over Twin Peaks, so I went up with a coffee on Saturday morning to enjoy the spring energy and clear weather while it still lasts. This morning I awoke to rain, and rushed out to meet it head on with a much chillier and wetter walk to twin peaks. Just as invigorating though! It’s nice to see the chronicle is on board with my assertion last week that the only cure for this weather is a nice little walk.\nRead I’m currently reading Jenny Odell’s How to Do Nothing. I picked it up years ago and got most of the way through it and really enjoyed it, but never ended up finishing it. It hits very differently in a Covid world and with a little bit of distance from the Trump presidency.\nI’ve been absolutely loving the brr blog, dispatches from a person from San Francisco who is spending about a year doing IT work in Antarctica. Each post is a little slice of life of what it’s like to live in Antarctica. My favorite posts so far are the ones about doors, showering and frost.\nAbsolutely my shit: S.F.’s ‘Bay Lights’ refused to go dark. It took a ‘Mission Impossible’ to literally pull the plug.\nHere’s how The Washington Post verified its journalists on Mastodon. I clicked this article assuming it would be a quick explanation of how Mastodon verifies links, but this was a more involved process than I expected, and was a fun read.\nThis guy has decided to visit every park in San Francisco, and I’m going to enjoy following along!\nMy buddy Paul Russo at Akita Software built an Exceedingly Polite AI Dog That Answers Questions About Your APIs. Love this!\nHell yeah, Monk’s coming back. I cannot wait to see how Monk handled the pandemic.\nSoleil Ho wrote about their experiment trying to live off food stamps for a week (big deal, I lived in Egypt for a month!). These sorts of articles are usually really cringey and out of touch (wow, poor people can’t buy organic avocados?!), but Soleil avoids all of that and leverages their chef expertise as well as previous experiences living off food stamps to write something really compelling.\nWatched I’m a huge fan of Krazam videos. I think their most recent, presented live on stage at a tech conference, is their most ambitious one yet, and their most successful. In an industry with possibly the worst collective sense of humor imaginable, we are blessed with a Krazam that we do not deserve. My alma mater Purdue University entered the NCAA tournament this weekend as the number 1 seed in their bracket. This was preceded by many breathless articles about the uniqueness of their situation, having built their entire team around a 7-foot-4 305 pound center whose singular weakness, as far as I can tell, is that he simply is not good at basketball. Purdue has never failed to disappoint me over the years, so I was delighted to watch the team absolutely crumble in the very first game, becoming only the second #1 seed ever to lose to a #16 seed in the first round. Yesterday I got a little more of my schadenfreude fix with this detailed writeup of what it was like to work the broadcast for such a historic game. Also, be sure to check out photos of their demented mascot Purdue Pete throughout history.\nI saw the trailer for the Blackberry movie and refuse to believe that that’s the actual tone of the movie. With that cast and that premise, it has to be a parody. But we do live in an era of Ben Affleck directing a film about the white guys at Nike who dared to ask Michael Jordan to wear their shoe, so I don’t know what to think anymore. Instead of embedding either of those videos, please enjoy this incredible old sketch from the writer, director, and one of the stars of the Blackberry movie. Actors Roundtable with Justin Theroux, Rajat Suresh, Jeremy Levick \u0026 More. I haven’t made it all the way through this, but it’s really an incredible piece of media. Props to Justin Theroux for being so game in this, although it’s not as surprising if you know that he co-wrote Tropic Thunder. Back to the Blackberry movie, I think Glenn Howerton’s Always Sunny colleague Rob McElhenney said everything that needed to be said on the issue: pic.twitter.com/oCEFSiAHbr\n— Rob McElhenney (@RMcElhenney) February 22, 2023 In Movies, I finally got around to watching Won’t You Be My Neighbor? and really enjoyed that. I watched the trailer for the one where Tom Hanks plays Mr. Rogers but think I got what I was looking for from the documentary.\nAlso, The Riddick Trilogy is currently streaming on Netflix. I don’t know that I’d recommend them, but watching them sure is a trip.\nLike most of us, I’ve been watching a lot of clips of Lance Reddick after his untimely passing this week. My favorite so far was this anecdote and corresponding video about his appearance on the Eric Andre Show. I’d also really like to know more about his on-stage depiction of Roman performing a fake script called Fast Nein: The Fast and the Fuhrer. I read on a clickbait site that Lance Reddick didnt know the show,did reserch,was confused but dug it. But wrote he own ideas for his bit. So very little of this skit was eric andre's ideas lol (yes eric legit did get scared by the table thing) https://t.co/ua96bG3vGe pic.twitter.com/dkdpTbJaJr\n— Wintermutetant 🇿🇦 (@ProjectAuuman) March 18, 2023 Played I haven’t played anything new, but did pick up a couple of games from the Steam Spring Sale: Red Dead Redemption 2, Dead Cells, and No Man’s Sky. If my current Steam collection is any indication, I will never play any of these games. I’ve had Bioshock at the “top of my queue” since 2007 and still haven’t played it, despite purchasing it at least 4 times.\nI’ve been playing Fantasy Survivor this season, and have been in first place in my league for the last two weeks. I’m getting in my gloating now as I’m sure I will fall off my perch very soon. The web site for this is incredibly confusing to navigate, the rules are too complicated, and it’s easy to forget to vote every single week. I thrive in the chaos.\nComputered Velja is a really great free utility that I’ve added to my setup recently. You set it to be your default browser, and then you can configure it to open different URL patterns in different applications. I don’t use it for much, but the built-in Zoom functionality means that Zoom links open directly in Zoom instead of littering my browser with useless zoom tabs that I need to clean up. There’s also a great option to strip tracking parameters out of links, but I have that disabled for web development reasons. Shoutout to the Velja developer for a dedicated part of the FAQ to explain why this can’t “just work” for Slack. A top-tier free “set it and forget it” application.\nOne Sec App. I recently tried out One Sec for about a week, it’s sort of a souped up version of iOS’s existing Screen Time functionality. It’s got some great ideas, for example I really like the choices of different animations when you need to take a break before using an application. Taking a single slow deep breath is always helpful and restorative, yet I almost never think to do it. Ultimately I stopped using the app because the implementation method was sort of flakey and a pain to set up (everything is done using iOS shortcuts, which you must painfully set up manually for each app you want to limit your time on). This is Apple’s fault for limitations around its APIs, not the creators of One Sec. Personally I’m hoping that Apple Sherlocks them and builds most of this functionality directly into Screen Time itself.\nok, bye.\n","wordCount":"1452","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://drew.shoes/images/twin%20peaks.jpg","datePublished":"2023-03-19T14:06:22-07:00","dateModified":"2023-03-19T14:06:22-07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Drew Schuster"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://drew.shoes/posts/ul-03-19-2023/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"drew dot shoes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://drew.shoes/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://drew.shoes accesskey=h title="drew dot shoes (Alt + H)">drew dot shoes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://drew.shoes/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://drew.shoes/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://drew.shoes/feed.xml title=rss><span>RSS</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Unordered List 03-19-2023</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-03-19 14:06:22 -0700 -0700'>March 19, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Drew Schuster</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://drew.shoes/images/twin%20peaks.jpg alt="View from a rainy Sunday morning Twin Peaks hike."><p>View from a rainy Sunday morning Twin Peaks hike.</p></figure><div class=post-content><h1 id=did>Did<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#did>#</a></h1><p>Nothing super interesting to report.

So very little of this skit was eric andre's ideas lol<br><br>(yes eric legit did get scared by the table thing) <a href=https://t.co/ua96bG3vGe>https://t.co/ua96bG3vGe</a> <a href=https://t.co/dkdpTbJaJr>pic.twitter.com/dkdpTbJaJr</a></p>&mdash; Wintermutetant 🇿🇦 (@ProjectAuuman) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectAuuman/status/1637095696544169985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script></p></li></ul><h1 id=played>Played<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#played>#</a></h1><ul><li><p>I haven&rsquo;t played anything new, but did pick up a couple of games from the <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3694679839286985808 target=_blank rel=noopener>Steam Spring Sale</a>: Red Dead Redemption 2, Dead Cells, and No Man&rsquo;s Sky. If my current Steam collection is any indication, I will never play any of these games. I&rsquo;ve had Bioshock at the &ldquo;top of my queue&rdquo; since 2007 and still haven&rsquo;t played it, despite purchasing it at least 4 times.</p></li><li><p>I&rsquo;ve been playing <a href=https://www.fantasysurvivorgame.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Fantasy Survivor</a> this season, and have been in first place in my league for the last two weeks. I&rsquo;m getting in my gloating now as I&rsquo;m sure I will fall off my perch very soon. The web site for this is incredibly confusing to navigate, the rules are too complicated, and it&rsquo;s easy to forget to vote every single week. I thrive in the chaos.</p></li></ul><h1 id=computered>Computered<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#computered>#</a></h1><ul><li><p><a href=https://sindresorhus.com/velja target=_blank rel=noopener>Velja</a> is a really great free utility that I&rsquo;ve added to my setup recently. You set it to be your default browser, and then you can configure it to open different URL patterns in different applications. I don&rsquo;t use it for much, but the built-in Zoom functionality means that Zoom links open directly in Zoom instead of littering my browser with useless zoom tabs that I need to clean up. There&rsquo;s also a great option to strip tracking parameters out of links, but I have that disabled for web development reasons. Shoutout to the Velja developer for a dedicated part of the FAQ to explain why <a href=https://sindresorhus.com/velja#slack target=_blank rel=noopener>this can&rsquo;t &ldquo;just work&rdquo; for Slack</a>. A top-tier free &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; application.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://one-sec.app/ target=_blank rel=noopener>One Sec App</a>. I recently tried out One Sec for about a week, it&rsquo;s sort of a souped up version of iOS&rsquo;s existing Screen Time functionality. It&rsquo;s got some great ideas, for example I really like the choices of different animations when you need to take a break before using an application. Taking a single slow deep breath is always helpful and restorative, yet I almost never think to do it. Ultimately I stopped using the app because the implementation method was sort of flakey and a pain to set up (everything is done using iOS shortcuts, which you must painfully set up manually for each app you want to limit your time on). This is Apple&rsquo;s fault for limitations around its APIs, not the creators of One Sec. Personally I&rsquo;m hoping that Apple Sherlocks them and builds most of this functionality directly into Screen Time itself.</p></li></ul><p>ok, bye.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://drew.shoes/tags/newsletter/>newsletter</a></li><li><a href=https://drew.shoes/tags/ul/>ul</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2023 <a href=https://drew.shoes>drew dot shoes</a></span>
